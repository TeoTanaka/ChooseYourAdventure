display map roughly 30 mins- took roughly 10
display troop icons 5 mins -took roughly 1 hour
do turn system roughly 45 mins -took roughly 1 hour
made random terrain 30 mins - took roughly 10 mins

INITIAL DESIGN
print map
+random terrain generation

if purchase = "soldier"
    add a soldier
etc.

for every troop
    get w a s d directions
    move around


NOTES
I would've liked to add a fortress option where you can build castles and create defenses
+ an income system based on how many farms/castles you have etc.
I would've liked to add random enemies like bandits and giants to add some more randomness
I would've liked to add a single player game mode

Maybe I'll add these on my own time but overall I think it turned out pretty well for a weekend ish project
